## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Command not found: python"**

   - Make sure Python is installed
   - Try using `python3` instead of `python`

2. **"externally-managed-environment" error**

   - This is normal on newer Python installations
   - Make sure you're using a virtual environment as described above

3. **"ModuleNotFoundError"**

   - Make sure you've activated the virtual environment
   - Reinstall dependencies: `pip install PyMuPDF Pillow`

4. **Path errors**
   - Use forward slashes (/) even on Windows
   - Make sure paths don't have quotes around them
   - Check for typos in file/folder names

For any other issues, make sure:

1. Your virtual environment is activated (`(venv)` visible in terminal)
2. All paths exist and are accessible
3. You have write permissions in the output directories
